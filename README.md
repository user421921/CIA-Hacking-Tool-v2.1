# CIA-Hacking-Tool-v2.1
This is a take on my original CIA Hacking tool. this version has a lot more hacking tools but a lot more dependencies. The links can be found in the comments inside the code.
It is a bash/shell script so you can as a .sh extention if you want.

how to use:

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

cd CIA-Hacking-Tool-v2.1/

chmod +x cia

./cia

FAQ:

what happens when i get an error from firefox?
the error is usally using cia as root, firefox doesn't  support being run as root, try running the program without root.

how do I get the tools that i dont already have?
you can get the binarys for the sites, or try apt/apt-get. if both of those dont work then install parrot security os.
